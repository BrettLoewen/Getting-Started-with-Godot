# Getting Started with Godot

## Running

-   Download Godot 4.2 [here](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/)
    -   If you want to work with C#, download the .NET version. Otherwise download the regular version. This project does not use C#.
-   Extract the downloaded zip folder
    -   The file you care about is `Godot_v4.2-stable_win64`. This is the Godot executable. Feel free to rename it.
    -   If you downloaded the .NET version, you need to keep the executable in the same folder as the GodotSharp folder
    -   Create a shortcut to the executable or pin it to the Start menu and/or taskbar if you want
-   Run Godot
-   Select the import option and follow the prompts to find this project
-   Once imported, open the project
-   Once opened, run the game by pressing the run button in the top right corner of the editor

## What is this?

This repo is a collection of the work I did while following some Godot beginner tutorials to learn the basics of the engine.
